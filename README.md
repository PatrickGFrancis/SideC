- Only people with your app's link can find your tracks
- Won't show up in Internet Archive search
- Won't be indexed by Google

### How It Works
- Your music files upload to **your** Internet Archive account
- SideC stores only metadata (track names, durations, etc.)
- Files stream directly from IA to your device
- No one can access your music without your links

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Best Practices
- **Use album covers** - they look great on mobile and your lock screen
- **Fill in track info** - title and artist make searching easier later
- **Organize by albums** - easier to find music than one giant list
- **Check upload progress** - wait for "Processing..." to complete for best quality

### Mobile Tips
- **Add to home screen** - SideC works like a native app (Safari → Share → Add to Home Screen)
- **Use lock screen controls** - play/pause/skip without unlocking your phone
- **Swipe gestures** - faster than tapping buttons
- **Portrait orientation** - designed for one-handed use

### Troubleshooting
- **Track won't play?** Wait a minute - it might still be processing
- **Slow uploads?** Check your internet connection
- **Missing duration?** Refresh the page after upload completes
- **Lock screen not working?** Make sure you're on iOS 15+ or Chrome 73+

## 🎯 Why We Built This

Music streaming services are expensive and don't let you own your music. Buying MP3s is great, but where do you store them? Cloud storage costs money.

**SideC solves this:**
- Store unlimited music for free using Internet Archive
- Stream from anywhere like Spotify
- Actually own your music files
- No monthly fees, ever
- Open source and transparent

---

## 📱 Mobile Apps

Currently, SideC is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** - use it right from your browser:

### iPhone (iOS)
1. Open SideC in Safari
2. Tap the Share button
3. Tap "Add to Home Screen"
4. Now it works like a native app!

### Android
1. Open SideC in Chrome
2. Tap the menu (⋮)
3. Tap "Add to Home Screen" or "Install App"
4. Launch from your home screen!
